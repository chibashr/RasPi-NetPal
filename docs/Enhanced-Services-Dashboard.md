## API Endpoints

The enhanced services dashboard uses these endpoints:

### Get Service List
```
GET /get_updates
Returns: Array of services with basic information
```

### Get Service Details
```
GET /get_service_details/<service_name>
Returns: Detailed service information including logs and configuration
```

### Restart Service
```
POST /restart_service/<service_name>
Returns: Success/failure status and updated service list
```

## Logging and Monitoring

### Service Activity Logs

All service management actions are logged:

- **Service restarts**: When and by whom
- **Status changes**: Automatic detection of status changes
- **Error conditions**: Failed operations and reasons
- **Configuration changes**: When service settings are modified

### Performance Impact

The enhanced monitoring is designed to be lightweight:

- **Cached Data**: Service information is cached between requests
- **Efficient Updates**: Only changed services trigger updates
- **Background Processing**: Heavy operations run asynchronously
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents excessive system calls
